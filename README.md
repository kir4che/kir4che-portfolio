# My Portfolio

This project is a one-page portfolio website designed specifically for frontend roles. It allows users to quickly browse through sections like About Me, Work Experience, Tech Stack, and Live Projects. Built with React and TypeScript, the interface emphasizes both visual clarity and effective communication, enabling recruiters or collaborators to understand my professional background and skills at a glance.
